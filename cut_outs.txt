\section{Representations of Topological Groups}
\subsection{Basic Definitions}
A topological group is a group that has been endowed with a topology. Most of the definitions regarding representations of topological groups are very similar to those for finite groups, but typically also require some kind of continuity. 
The following definitions are given by \cite{alex}.

\begin{defi}[Topological group]\end{defi}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A group $G$ endowed with a Hausdorff topology is a \textbf{topological group} if 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The left and right multiplication maps $L_g : G \to G : h \mapsto gh$ and $R_g : G \to G : h \mapsto hg$ are continuous for every $g$.
        \item The inverse map $\inv: G \to G : g \mapsto g^{-1}$  is continuous.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item A \textbf{morphism} between topological groups is a continuous group homomorphism.
\end{enumerate}

Primarily, we are interested in the case where $G$ is compact under the topology $\tau$. Some examples of compact topological groups include all finite groups with discrete topology, discrete groups such as $\Z$ (also with discrete topology), and Lie groups. 

\begin{defi}[G-space]\end{defi}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A locally compact topological space $X$ is a $G$\textbf{-space} if there is a continuous map $X \to X$ given by $x \mapsto gx$ for every $g\in G$ and
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $g_1 (g_2 x) = (g_1 g_2)x$ for all $g_1, g_2 \in G$
        \item $ex = x$ where $e$ is the identity in $G$.
    \end{enumerate} 
    \item A \textbf{morphism} between two $G$-spaces $X$ and $Y$ is a continuous map $\phi: X \to Y$ satisfying $\phi(gx) = g \phi(x)$ for all $g \in G, x \in X$. 
\end{enumerate}

Representations of $G$ arise when $X$ is also endowed with a vector space structure. 

\begin{defi}[Topological vector space]
    A \textbf{topological vector space} is a vector space equipped with a Hausdorff topology for which addition and scalar multiplication are continuous.
\end{defi}

\begin{eg}
    Suppose that $V$ is a finite dimensional vector space. Then the standard topology inherited via a linear isomorphism $V \simeq R^n$ is the unique topology which makes $V$ into a topological vector space. \cite{alex}
\end{eg}

For our purposes, the most important example of a topological vector space is a Hilbert space.

\begin{defi}[Hilbert Space]
    Suppose $V$ is a vector space endowed with an inner product $\anglet{\cdot}{\cdot}$. Then $V$ can be made into a topological vector space by the the topology induced by the metric $d(x, y) = \sqrt{\anglet{x}{y}}$. $V$ is then a \textbf{Hilbert space} if it is complete with respect to the metric $d$. 
\end{defi}

For any topological vector space $V$, we can define $GL(V)$ to be the set of continuous automorphisms on $V$. This set is itself a finite dimensional vector space, and is therefore made into a topological vector space in the canonical way.

As is the case with finite groups, representations of topological groups can be viewed as either homomorphisms, linear actions or modules. We give one definition here; the other viewpoints relate in the same way as before.

\begin{defi}[G-representation]\end{defi}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose $G$ is a topological group. A \textbf{representation} of $G$ on a topological vector space $V$ is a continuous homomorphism $\pi: G \to GL(V)$. The induced linear action of $G$ on $V$ is given by $gv = \pi(g)v$.
    \item A \textbf{morphism} between $G$-representations $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ on $V_1$ and $V_2$ respectively is continuous linear map $T: V_1 \to V_2$ such that $T \circ \pi_1(g) = \pi_1(g) \circ T$ for all $g\in G$. It is clear that this is a $G$-space morphism when $V_1$ and $V_2$ are considered $G$-spaces under the actions induced by $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$.
\end{enumerate}

If $V$ is a Hilbert space, we have a particularly important kind of representation.

\begin{defi}[Unitary representation]
    A representation $\pi$ of $G$ on a Hilbert space $\H$ is \textbf{unitary} if $\anglet{gv}{gw} = \anglet{v}{w}$ for all $v, w \in V$ and $g \in G$.
\end{defi}

\subsection{Measures and Haar Measures}
Suppose $X$ is a locally compact topological space. Define $C(X)$ to be the vector space of continuous functions $X \to \C$. For a compact subset $K \subset X$, define $C_K(X) \subset C(X)$ to be the subspace of functions vanishing outside of $K$. Then endow this space with the topology generated by the supremum norm. We are now ready to make the 

\begin{defi}[Fuctions with compact support]
    The space of \textbf{continuous functions with compact support} is defined to be $$C_c(X) = \bigcup_K C_K(X),$$
    where $K$ ranges over all compact subsets of $X$. Define the topology on $C_c(X)$ to be the finest topology for which all inclusions $C_K(X) \subset C_c(X)$ are continuous.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}
    Suppose $X$ is a locally compact topological space. Then
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A \textbf{signed measure} on $X$ is a 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{defi}


Suppose $X$ is a locally compact topological space. Define $C(X)$ to be the vector space of continuous functions $X \to \C$. For a compact subset $K \subset X$, define $C_K(X) \subset C(X)$ to be the subspace of functions vanishing outside of $K$. Then endow this space with the topology generated by the supremum norm. 

\begin{defi}[Fuctions with compact support]
    The space of \textbf{continuous functions with compact support} is defined to be $$C_c(X) = \bigcup_K C_K(X),$$
    where $K$ ranges over all compact subsets of $X$. Define the topology on $C_c(X)$ to be the finest topology for which all inclusions $C_K(X) \subset C_c(X)$ are continuous.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}[Radon Measure]
    Suppose $X$ is a locally compact topological space. Then

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A \textbf{signed measure} on $X$ is a continuous linear functional $\mu$ on $C_{c}(X)$. Concretely, the continuity means that for every compact subset $K \subset X$ there exists $C>0$ such that $|\mu(f)| \leq C \cdot \sup_{x \in K}|f(x)|$ for every $f \in$ $C_{K}(X)$.
        \item A \textbf{measure} on $X$ is a signed measure $\mu$ on $X$ satisfying $\mu(f) \geq 0$ for $f \geq 0$.
        \item A \textbf{nowhere vanishing measure} on $X$ is a measure $\mu$ on $X$ satisfying $\mu(f)>0$ for $0 \neq f \geq 0$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{defi}

Let $G$ be a locally compact topological group. For $g \in G$ and $f \in C_{c}(G)$, we define $\left(L_{g} f\right)(x)=f\left(g^{-1} x\right)$ and $\left(R_{g} f\right)(x)=f(x g).$ A measure $\mu$ on $G$ is called left- $G$ -invariant (right- $G$ -invariant) if $\mu\left(L_{g} f\right)=\mu(f)\left(\mu\left(R_{g} f\right)=\mu(f)\right)$ for every $g \in G, f \in C_{c}(G).$

\section{Lie Theory}

\subsection{Manifolds}
We begin by reviewing some manifold theory.

\begin{defi}[Manifold]
    Let $M$ be a set with a second countable Hausdorff topology $\tau$. A $n$ dimensional smooth structure on $M$ consists of the following elements:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A collection of connected open sets $V_\alpha \in \tau$ whose union is $M$. 
        \item A collection of homomorphisms $\phi_\alpha : V_\alpha \to U_\alpha$, where $U_\alpha$ is a connected open subset of $\R^n$. These are known as charts
    \end{enumerate}
    $M$ is made into an $n$ dimensional \textbf{manifold} if the charts are compatible: for all $\phi_\alpha$ and $\phi_\beta$, we must have $\phi_\alpha(V_\alpha \cap V_\beta)$ open in $\R^n$ and $$\phi_\alpha \circ  \phi_\beta ^{-1}: \phi_\beta(V_\alpha \cap V_\beta) \to \phi_\alpha(V_\alpha \cap V_\beta)$$ must be smooth maps on $\R^n$.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}[Smooth map between manifolds]
    Suppose that $M$ with charts $\phi_\alpha$ and $N$ with charts $\psi_\beta$ are smooth $m$ and $n$ dimensional manifolds respectively. A function $f: M \to N$ is smooth iff for all $\phi_\alpha$ and $\psi_\beta$, we have that $\psi_\beta \circ f \circ \phi_\alpha^{-1}$ is a smooth map from $\R^m$ to $\R^n$ in the usual sense.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}[Diffeomorphism]
    A smooth map $f$ between two manifolds $M$ and $N$ is a \textbf{diffeomorphism} if $f^{-1}$ exists and is also a smooth map.
\end{defi}

In particular, a diffeomorphism is a special type of homeomorphism between topological spaces.

We omit the proof of the following proposition.

\begin{prop}[Product manifold]
    Suppose that $M$ with topology $\tau_M$ and smooth structure $(V_\alpha, \phi_\alpha)$ and $N$ with topology $\tau_N$ and smooth structure $(U_\beta, \psi_\beta)$ are smooth $m$ and $n$ dimensional manifolds respectively. Then 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $M \times N$ with the product topology $\tau_M \times \tau_N$ is a manifold when endowed with charts $\phi_{\alpha\beta}: V_\alpha \times U_\beta \to \R^m \times \R^n: (v, u) \mapsto (\phi(v), \psi(u))$.
        \item If $X$ and $Y$ are submanifolds of $M$ and $N$ respectively, then $X \times Y$ is a submanifold of $M \times N$.
    \end{enumerate}
    In particular, for any $x \in M$, $\{x\} \times N$ is a submanifold of $M \times N$.
\end{prop}

\subsection{Lie groups}

A Lie group is a group $G$ that is also a smooth manifold. 

\begin{defi}[Lie Group]
    Let $G$ be a group that is also a manifold under a given topology $\tau$ and smooth structure $(V_\alpha, \phi_\alpha)$. Then $G$ is a \textbf{Lie group} iff 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $m: G \times G \to G : (g, h) \mapsto gh$ and
        \item $\inv: G \to G : g \mapsto g^{-1}$ 
    \end{enumerate}
    are both smooth maps between manifolds.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}[Lie group homomorphism]
    A map between two lie groups $G$ and $H$ is a \textbf{lie group homomorphism} if it is a homomorphism of groups that is also a smooth map.
\end{defi}

A homomorphism of Lie groups $f$ is an isomorphism if $f^{-1}$ exists and is also a Lie group homomorphism. Equivalently, an isomorphism of Lie groups is a diffeomorphism that is also a homomorphism in both directions.

For a given $n$ dimensional vector space $V$, the general linear group $GL(V)$ is a Lie group with manifold structure inherited from $\R^{n^2}$.

\begin{thm}
    Suppose $G$ is a Lie group, $H$ a connected manifold and $\phi: H \to G$ is a covering space map. If $e' \in \phi^{-1}(\{e\})$, then there is a unique Lie group structure on $H$ such that $e'$ is the identity and $\phi$ is a homomorphism of Lie groups. In this case, the kernel of $\phi$ is in the center of $H$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
    Suppose $H$ is a Lie group, and $\Gamma \subseteq Z(H)$ is a  discrete subgroup of its center. Then there is a unique Lie group structure on $G = H / \Gamma$ such that the quotient map $H \to G$ is a Lie group homomorphism. 
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
    Suppose $G$ is a connected Lie group, and $U \subseteq G$ is any neighborhood of the identity. Then $U$ generates $G$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
First of all, note that any neighborhood of a point contains an open neighborhood of that point, so if necessary we replace $U$ with open subset. $U^{-1}$ is also an open neighborhood of the identity, so if necessary, we further replace $U$ with $U \cap U^{-1}$ such that $U=U^{-1}$.

Let $S$ be the set generated by $U$. For any $g \in S$, the left action of $g$ is a diffeomorphism, so $gU$ is open because $U$ is. Now write $H = G \setminus S$. If $hu \in S$ for any $u \in U$, $h \in H$, then $huu^{-1} = h$ is also in $S$, so we must have that $hU$ is disjoint with $S$. Hence as $hU$ is also open, $H' = \bigcup_{h \in H} hU$ is a open subset of $G$ that is disjoint from $S$ with $G = H' \cup S$. By the connectedness of $G$, since $S$ is nonempty, we must have $G=S$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{defi}[Lie group action]
    Let $G$ be a Lie group and let $X$ be a manifold. A \textbf{Lie group action} of $G$ on $X$ is a group action $G \times X \to X : (g, x) \mapsto gx$ that is also a differentiable map between manifolds. 
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}[Left and right actions]
    For any $g$ an element of a Lie group $G$, the \textbf{left action} of $g$ is $L_g : G \to G: h \mapsto gh$. Similarly, the \textbf{right action} of $g$ is $R_g : G \to G: h \mapsto hg$.
\end{defi}

\begin{thm}
    For any element $g\in G$, the left and right actions of $G$ are diffeomorphisms on $G$. 
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
The left action of $g$ is the restriction of the multiplication map $m$ to the Lie subgroup $\{g\} \times G = \{(g, h) : h \in G\}$. This can be written as $L_g = m \circ \iota$, so as the composition of smooth maps, $L_g$ is also smooth. $L_{g^{-1}}$ is an obvious smooth inverse, so $L_g$ is a diffeomorphism. The argument for $R_g$ is the same.
\end{proof}

\begin{defi}[Conjugation action]
    For any $g \in S$, the \textbf{Conjugation action} $\Psi_g : G \to G$ of $g$ is composed of left and right actions: $\Psi_g(h) = L_g \circ R_g^{-1}(h) = ghg^{-1}$. 
\end{defi}

As a composition of diffeomorphisms, the conjugation action is itself a diffeomorphism. From elementary group theory, we know that the conjugation action is also a homomorphism with an inverse that is also a homomorphism. Hence the conjugation action is in fact a Lie group isomorphism.

As expected, A Lie group representation is a Lie group homomorphism from $G$ to $GL(V)$ for some vector space $V$. This can also be viewed as a linear Lie action on a vector space $V$ where $V$ is made into a manifold in the natural way. The conjugation map $\Psi_g$ gives a particularly nice Lie group representation.

Since $\Psi_g$ fixes the identity $e$ in $G$, the derivative $(d\Psi_g)_e : T_e G \to T_e G$ is an endomorphism on $T_e G$. Furthermore, because $\Psi_g$ is a Lie group isomorphism, $\Psi_g^{-1}$ is smooth, so $(d\Psi_g)^{-1}_e$ exists. Therefore $(d\Psi_g)_e$ is actually an automorphism on $T_e G$. This motivates the following definition.

\begin{defi}[Adjoint representation of a Lie group]
    Suppose $G$ is a Lie group. The \textbf{adjoint representation} $\Ad: G \to \Aut(T_e G)$ of $G$ is the map $\Ad(g) = (d\Psi_g)_e$.
\end{defi}

\subsection{Lie Algebras}
We begin with the definition of a Lie algebra.

\begin{defi}[Lie algebra]
    A vector space $V$ over a field $\F$ is a Lie algebra if it is endowed with a multiplication $V \times V \to V$ denoted $(x, y) \mapsto \bracket{x, y}$ such that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The bracket operation is bilinear.
        \item $\bracket{x, x} = 0$ for all $x \in V$. 
        \item $\bracket{x, \bracket{y, z}} + \bracket{y, \bracket{z, x}} + \bracket{z, \bracket{x, y}} = 0$
    \end{enumerate}
    The third requirement is known as the Jacobi identity.
\end{defi}

The first thing to note is that applying the first and second requirements to $\bracket{x + y, x + y}$ we see that $\bracket{x, y} = -\bracket{y, x}$, so the bracket is anti commutative. We also note that in general the bracket does not have to be associative (the Jacobi identity can be used to show that associativity will hold only when $\bracket{a, \bracket{b,c}} = 0)$ for all $a, b, c$).

Our first example of a Lie algebra is a very important one.

\begin{defi}[General linear algebra]
    For a given vector space $V$, the set of all endomorphisms on $V$ form an algebra with scalar multiplication from the field $\F$ in $V$. This vector space can be made into the \textbf{general linear algebra} $\gl(V)$ by replacing the standard product with a bracket operation where $$\bracket{x, y} = xy - yx$$
    for all $x, y \in V$.
\end{defi}

Any vector space $V$ can be made into a trivial lie algebra by defining $\bracket{x, y} = 0$ for all $x, y \in V$. Such a lie algebra is said to be \textbf{abelian}.

\begin{defi}[Lie algebra homomorphism]
    Suppose $\g$ and $\h$ are two Lie algebras. A function $\tau: \g \to \h$ is a \textbf{Lie algebra homomorphism} if for all $X, Y \in \g$, $$\tau(\bracket{X, Y}) = \bracket{\tau(X), \tau(Y)}$$ and $$\tau(\alpha X + \beta Y) = \alpha \tau(X) + \beta \tau(Y).$$
\end{defi}

As usual, a homomorphism is a monomorphism, epimorphism or isomorphism if it is respectively injective, surjective or bijective. Two Lie algebras $\g$ and $\h$ are said to be \textbf{isomorphic} if there exists a Lie algebra isomorphism between them. 

\begin{defi}[Subalgebra]
    Suppose $\g$ is a Lie algebra. A vector subspace $\h$ of $\g$ is a Lie subalgebra if it is closed under the bracket operation in $\g$: $\bracket{x, y} \in \h$ for all $x, y \in \h$.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}[ideal]
    An \textbf{ideal} $\a$ of a Lie algebra $\g$ is a subalgebra that has total closure: for all $x \in \g$ and $a \in \a$, $\bracket{a, x} \in \a$. According to skew symmetry, this is equivalent to requiring that $\bracket{x, a} \in \a$.
\end{defi}

When $\a$ is an ideal of a Lie algebra $\g$, the quotient vector space $\g/\a$ can be made into a Lie algebra under the bracket $\bracket{x + \a, y + \a} = \bracket{x, y} + \a$.


Just as a group representation was a group homomorphism into the general linear group, a lie algebra representation is a lie algebra homomorphism into the general linear algebra.

\begin{defi}[Representation of a Lie algebra]
    Suppose $\g$ is a Lie algebra. A \textbf{representation} of $\g$ on a vector space $V$ is a Lie algebra homomorphism 
    $$\tau : \g \to \gl(V).$$
\end{defi}

Suppose $\g$ is a Lie algebra, and $x \in \g$. The map $\ad x : \g \to \g: y \mapsto \bracket{x, y}$ is a derivation on $\g$. This gives rise to the following important Lie algebra representation.

\begin{defi}[Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra]
    The map $\Ad : \g \to \Der(\g) : x \mapsto \ad x$ is the \textbf{adjoint} representation of $\g$.
\end{defi}



\subsection{Lie algebras of U(n), SL(n, \texorpdfstring{$\C$}{C}) and SU(n)}

If we write $\mathfrak{u}(n)$ for the Lie algebra of $U(n)$, then for all $X \in \mathfrak{u}(n)$ and $t \in \R$, $e^{tX} \in U(n)$, so $e^{tX}e^{tX^\dagger} = 1$. Differentiating this expression with respect to $t$ yields the condition $X + X^\dagger = 0$. Therefore, elements of $\mathfrak{u}(n)$ must be skew adjoint matrices. This inspires the following proposition. 

\begin{prop}
    The Lie algebra $\mathfrak{u}(n)$ of $U(n)$ is precisely the set of skew adjoint $n \times n$ complex matrices.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    For a skew adjoint complex matrix, diagonal entries are imaginary and entries in the upper triangular section are completely determined by the lower triangular section. Therefore, there are $n + 2 \frac{n^2 - n }{2} = n^2$ real parameters in such a matrix.

    On the other hand, because the tangent space has the same dimension as the manifold, the dimension of $\mathfrak{u}(n)$ must be the same as $U(n)$. Unitary matrices are embedded in $2n^2$ real dimensional space, but are subject to $n$ real constraints normalizing the columns, and $\frac{n^2 - n }{2}$ complex constraints requiring that columns are orthogonal. Therefore $\mathfrak{u}(n)$ has dimension $2n^2 - n - 2 \frac{n^2 - n }{2} = n^2$ as well. 
    
    Therefore, every skew adjoint matrix must also be in $\mathfrak{u}(n)$ because $\mathfrak{u}(n)$ is a subset of the skew adjoint matrices with the same dimension.
\end{proof}

In the case of $SL(n, \C)$, we can again use the exponential map to examine the Lie algebra: for any element $X \in \sl(n, \C)$, we have $\det(e^X) = 1$, so as $\det(e^X) = e^{\tr(X)}$, we have that $\tr(X) = 0$. 

\begin{prop}
    The Lie algebra $\sl{u}(n)$ of $SL(n, \C)$ is precisely the set of traceless $n \times n$ complex matrices. 
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    As both the trace and determinant map a matrix to the complex numbers, both conditions impose two constraints on the matrices. 
    
    Therefore, every traceless $n \times n$ complex matrix must also be in $\sl{u}(n)$ because $\sl{u}(n)$ is a subset with the same dimension.
\end{proof}

As $SU(n)$ is the intersection of $SL(n, \C)$ and $U(n)$, the lie algebra $\su(n)$ of $SU(n)$ is just the intersection of $\sl(n, \C)$ and $\mathfrak{u}(n)$. 

\begin{prop}
    $SL(n, \C)$ is the set of $n \times n$ complex skew adjoint traceless matrices: $$\su(n) = \{X \in M(n, \C) : X^\dagger = -X, \tr(X) = 0\}.$$
\end{prop}


\subsection{Irreducible representations of U(1)}
$U(1)$ is the set of unitary one by one matrices. Therefore $U(1)$ is just the unit circle in the complex numbers. This group is clearly abelian, so by the first corollary of Schur's lemma, the irreducible representations of $U(1)$ must be one dimensional. This implies that any irreducible representation $\rho$ of $U(1)$ is actually just an automorphism on $U(1)$. This gives us our first lemma.

\begin{lemma}
    Any irreducible representation $\rho$ of $U(1)$ is of the form $$\rho(e^{i\theta}) = e^{ik\theta}$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    As argued above, we must have that $\rho$
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
    Suppose that $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ are respectively representations of $\su(2)$ and $\sl(2, \C)$ on a vector space $V$. Then $\pi_1$ is irreducible if $\pi_2$ is irreducible.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose that $W$ is a proper subset of a complex vector space $V$ such that $\pi_2(z) w \in W$ for any $z \in \sl(2,\C), w \in W$. Then $\pi_1(x) w = \pi_2(\phi(x))w \in W$, 
    
    so for any $z \in \sl(2, \C)$, $\pi_2(z) w = \pi_2(x + iy) w = \pi_2(x) w + i\pi_2(y) w \in W$.

    Suppose that $W$ is a proper subset of a complex vector space $V$ such that $\pi_1(x) w \in W$ for any $x \in \su(2), w \in W$. Then $\pi_1(ix) w = i\pi_1(x)w \in W$, so for any $z \in \sl(2, \C)$, $\pi_2(z) w = \pi_2(x + iy) w = \pi_2(x) w + i\pi_2(y) w \in W$.
    
    $\pi_1$ is an irreducible representation of $\su(2)$ on $V$, and $\pi_2(x) w \in W$ for all 
\end{proof}

We will therefore work primarily with $\sl(2, \C)$, and derive representations of $\su(2)$ as a consequence. 


A basis for $\sl(2, \C)$ is given by 

$$e = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0\end{pmatrix}, \hspace{2em} f = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0\end{pmatrix}, \hspace{2em} h = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1\end{pmatrix}.$$

\subsection{Measures and Haar Measures}
Suppose $X$ is a locally compact topological space. Define $C(X)$ to be the vector space of continuous functions $X \to \C$. For a compact subset $K \subset X$, define $C_K(X) \subset C(X)$ to be the subspace of functions vanishing outside of $K$. Then endow this space with the topology generated by the supremum norm. We are now ready to make the

Let $G$ be a locally compact topological group. For $g \in G$ and $f \in C_{c}(G)$, we define $\left(L_{g} f\right)(x)=f\left(g^{-1} x\right)$ and $\left(R_{g} f\right)(x)=f(x g).$ A measure $\mu$ on $G$ is called left- $G$ -invariant (right- $G$ -invariant) if $\mu\left(L_{g} f\right)=\mu(f)\left(\mu\left(R_{g} f\right)=\mu(f)\right)$ for every $g \in G, f \in C_{c}(G).$
\begin{thm}(Existence of Haar Measure)
    Suppose $G$ is a locally compact topological group. Then there exists a non-zero left-G-invariant measure $\mu$ on $G$. This measure is unique in the sense that if $\lambda$ is another such measure, then $\lambda$ is a scalar multiple of $\mu$.
\end{thm}



\subsection{Complete Reducibility}
Several objects from the representations of finite groups carry over without adjustment. In particular, subrepresentations and irreducible representations of topological groups are defined in the same way as for finite groups. Furthermore, Schur's lemma is unchanged.

\subsection{Peter Weyl Theorem}
Among other things, the Peter Weyl theorem states that .

Now consider the two curves $\alpha(t) = \phi(s + t)$ and $\beta(t) = \phi(s)\phi(t)$ for some constant $s$. Then $\alpha(0) = \phi(s) = \beta(0)$ and ??? so we see that $\alpha(t) = \beta(t)$.

The total angular momentum is the sum of spin and orbital angular momentum. We see that this arises from . If a system begins in a given eigenspace, then any action of SO(3) will leave that eigenspace invariant, therefore ensuring that angular momentum is conserved. This is the essence of Noether's theorem.


The point of this proposition is to show that these weight spaces of ${h}$ form chains with weights incrementing by $2$. The next two propositions shows that there is exactly one such chain.

\begin{prop}
    Suppose that $\sl(2, \C)$ acts linearly on a finite dimensional vector space $V$. Then there exists an eigenvector $w \in V$ for $H$ such that ${e} w = 0$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    As $\C$ is algebraically closed, ${h}$ must have at least one eigenvalue with an eigenvalue $v$. Then if $v, {e}v, {e}^2v, \hdots$ are all non zero, then they must all be eigenvectors of ${h}$ with distinct eigenvalues. This would be an infinite sequence of independent vectors in $V$, which is impossible because $V$ is finite dimensional. Hence there exists an eigenvector $w = {e}^k v$ for ${h}$ such that ${e}w = {e}^{k+1}v = 0$ for some $k$. 
\end{proof}



\begin{prop}
    If $w$ is a maximal vector of a vector space $V$ with dimension $n$, then $\beta = \{w, {f}w, \hdots, {f}^{n-1} w\}$ is a basis for $V$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    As elements of $\beta$ are eigenvectors of ${h}$ with distinct eigenvalues, they are linearly independent. Therefore, We aim to show that $W = \text{span}_{\C}(\beta)$ is an invariant subspace of $V$. The irreducibility of $V$ will then imply that $W = V$.
    
    Clearly, $W$ is closed under the action of ${h}$ and ${f}$, so we only need to check that it is also closed under the action of ${e}$. As $\bracket{{f}, {e}} = -{h}$, 
    \begin{align*}
        {e}{f}^m w &= {e}{f}^m
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

we get a basis for $V$, on which the action of $\pi(X_j)$ is determined:
$$\pi(X_1) = i\pi^*({e}+{f}), \pi(X_1) = \pi^*({e}-{f}), \pi(X_1) = -i\pi^*({h}).$$
