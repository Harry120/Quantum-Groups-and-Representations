\subsection{Axioms of Quantum Mechanics}
\subsubsection{States and Observables}
Classically, a particle is characterised by its properties - a particle is an entity with a specified position, momentum, energy etc. One of the key features of Quantum Mechanics is that it allows for discussion of a particle without reference to these properties. This is facilitated by introducing the notion of a state vector, which resides in a physical$^\dagger$ Hilbert space. 

\begin{axiom}[Representation of State] 
    Any physical system has a corresponding Hilbert Space $\h$. The state of a particle at time $t$ is represented by a unit vector $\ket{\psi(t)} \in \h$.
\end{axiom}

Instead of characterising the particle, quantum mechanics postulates that observable properties are hermitian operators with an orthogonally normalisable basis of eigenstates (an eigenbasis). The notion that a particle has a specific value for a given observable is then discarded - instead, we expand $\ket{\psi}$ in the eigenbasis corresponding to $\Omega$, and say that the probability of measuring the particle in the eigenstate $\ket{\omega}$ is the inner product $\anglet{\omega}{\psi}$ of $\ket{\psi}$ with $\ket{\omega}$. 

\begin{axiom}[Observable]
    Every observable property of the state is described by a hermitian operator $\Omega: \h \to \h$, with an orthogonally normalisable basis of eigenvectors $\ket{\omega}$. 
\end{axiom}


\begin{axiom}[Measurement]
    When a particle is in the state $\ket{\psi} = \sum \alpha_\omega \ket{\omega}$ with $\anglet{\psi}{\psi} = 1$, measurement of $\Omega$ will yield the value $\omega$ with probability $\abs{\anglet{\omega}{\psi}}^2 = |\alpha_\omega|^2$. This measurement will cause the state of the particle to change from $\ket{\psi}$ to $\ket{\omega}$. 
\end{axiom}

This ensures that repeated measurements are consistent - if we measure the value of an observable to be $\omega$, the state of the particle will then be the eigenvector $\ket{\omega}$. If we then perform another measurement, the probability that the value of the observable is still $\omega$ is $\anglet{\omega}{\omega} = 1$.

We now list a few common operators.

\begin{defi}[Position operator] 
    We define the position operator $X$ by requiring that the position vector $\ket{x}$ (corresponding to the particle being at position $x$) is an eigenvector of $X$. i.e.  $X\ket{x} = x\ket{x}$. The wave function $\psi(x)$ is defined by the inner product of the state with $\ket{x}$ eigenbasis: $\psi(x) = \anglet{x}{\psi}$.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}[Momentum operator] 
    The momentum operator $P$ can be defined by its action on wave functions. We have $\bra{x}P\ket{\psi} = -i\hbar \psi'(x)$.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}[Hamiltonian operator] 
    The hamiltonian operator $H$ is defined by its action on wave functions: $\bra{x}P\ket{\psi} = -i\hbar \psi'(x)$.
\end{defi}
 
\subsubsection{Schrodinger Equation}
The final axiom of quantum mechanics describes how a state vector evolves through time.

\begin{axiom}[Schrodinger Equation]
    The state vector $\ket{\psi(t)}$ obeys $$i\hbar \frac{d}{dt}\ket{\psi(t)} = H\ket{\psi(t)},$$
    where $H$ is the energy operator (the Hamiltonian) of the system.
\end{axiom}

what is the wave function collapse?
 - properties are always found to be discrete, not smeared out
